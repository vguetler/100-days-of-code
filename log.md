### Day 1: May 6, 2020

Today's Progress: Started lesson 1 of Harvard's Statistics and R 

Thoughts: I have used R before but today learnt some features using the Swift package on R which were helpful.

### Day 2: May 11, 2020

Today's Progress: been busy the past few days with course work/grading. Catching up by continuing with base R codes, exercises on HarvardX Statistics and R course. Completed Week 1 exercises, next is Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis.

Thoughts: even though I know basic R, i.e. installing packages, loading data and performing basic functions. Going through the videos, explanations and doing the exercises has been helpful as I have learned new things I didn't know before such as starting a project and downloading data from Github to R directly. 

### Day 3: May 12, 2020

Today's Progress: continued with EDA exercises from the HarvardX Statistics and R course. Week 2 covers normal distributions, random variables, calculating p-values etc using R base syntax.

Thoughts: watching the videos help explain the concepts. Having learned and used R packages and now learning R base syntax is weird but good to know how they work.
